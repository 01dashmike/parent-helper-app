    <h1>🥄 Weaning Your Baby: A Science-Backed Guide for First-Time Parents</h1>
    <p>Weaning—the gradual transition from milk to solid food—is one of your baby’s biggest milestones. It can feel overwhelming, but with a little preparation and the right tools, it can also be one of the most rewarding stages of early parenthood.</p>

    <h2>📆 When Should You Start Weaning?</h2>
    <p>The NHS and World Health Organization recommend starting weaning at <strong>around 6 months</strong>. At this stage, most babies:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Can sit up with minimal support</li>
        <li>Show interest in food</li>
        <li>Have lost the tongue-thrust reflex</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>🍽️ Weaning Methods</h2>
    <h3>1. Traditional (Spoon-fed) Weaning</h3>
    <p>✅ Easy to batch-cook and freeze, good for iron-rich foods.<br>⚠️ Avoid processed jars and pouches.</p>

    <h3>2. Baby-Led Weaning (BLW)</h3>
    <p>✅ Encourages independence and texture exploration.<br>⚠️ Avoid hard foods that can cause choking.</p>

    <p>💡 Most parents combine both methods.</p>

    <h2>🧠 What the Science Says</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Babies need iron-rich foods from 6 months.</li>
        <li>Early exposure to allergens may reduce allergy risk.</li>
        <li>Variety early may reduce picky eating.</li>
    </ul>
