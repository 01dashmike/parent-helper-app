PARENTING TIP TUESDAY 💡 

Tummy time isn't just exercise - it's sensory exploration! Try this simple enhancement:

🔹 Place different textured fabrics under your baby during tummy time
🔹 Try velvet, corduroy, or soft scarves
🔹 This builds the foundation for crawling
🔹 Strengthens neck muscles naturally

Many of our sensory classes incorporate this technique too! Find sensory classes near you - link in bio 🔗
